Develop an app for covid-19 social cause.

Develop an app for covid-19 social cause. There are many people all over India who are not able to get food, especially daily wage labors stuck in cities. We can track people stuck without shelter and food. App will provide feature to report place where people are stuck(live photo and location)

This app could be used by anyone especially by NGOs, delivery guys, police and other volunteers who are already supporting them..
They could just report the location and number of ppl stuck (age, gender etc) so that you can an estimate of where and how many ppl are stuck and provide the basic needs like food,shelter and hygiene products.
